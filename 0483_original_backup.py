Project 483: Portfolio Optimization with AI
Description:
Portfolio optimization aims to select the best mix of assets to maximize returns and minimize risk. In this project, we'll implement a simple mean-variance optimization using historical returns of a set of assets. We’ll then use a genetic algorithm to optimize the weights of each asset in the portfolio.

🧪 Python Implementation (Portfolio Optimization with Genetic Algorithm)
You can later extend this project by:

Using real stock data from APIs like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or Quandl

Implementing advanced models such as Black-Litterman, Markowitz optimization, or machine learning-based approaches

# 1. Download historical stock data for a portfolio of assets (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Google)
assets = ["AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT", "AMZN", "TSLA"]
stock_data = yf.download(assets, start="2015-01-01", end="2021-01-01")['Adj Close']
 
# 2. Calculate daily returns
returns = stock_data.pct_change().dropna()
 
# 3. Simulate portfolio optimization using a genetic algorithm
 
# Helper function to calculate portfolio performance
def calculate_portfolio_performance(weights, mean_returns, cov_matrix):
    portfolio_return = np.sum(mean_returns * weights) * 252  # Annualized return
    portfolio_volatility = np.sqrt(np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(cov_matrix, weights))) * np.sqrt(252)  # Annualized volatility
    return portfolio_return, portfolio_volatility
 
# Fitness function (negative Sharpe Ratio) for genetic algorithm
def fitness_function(weights, mean_returns, cov_matrix, risk_free_rate=0.01):
    p_return, p_volatility = calculate_portfolio_performance(weights, mean_returns, cov_matrix)
    return -(p_return - risk_free_rate) / p_volatility  # We want to minimize this

    # Best portfolio from the final generation
    best_weights = population[0]
    return best_weights
 
# 5. Run genetic algorithm
best_weights = genetic_algorithm(returns)
 
# 6. Calculate portfolio performance for the best portfolio
mean_returns = returns.mean()
cov_matrix = returns.cov()
p_return, p_volatility = calculate_portfolio_performance(best_weights, mean_returns, cov_matrix)
 
# 7. Display results
print(f"Optimal Portfolio Weights: {best_weights}")
print(f"Annualized Return: {p_return:.2f}")
print(f"Annualized Volatility: {p_volatility:.2f}")
 
# 8. Visualize portfolio performance
portfolio_value = 1000000  # Start with $1,000,000 investment
investment = portfolio_value * np.array(best_weights)
portfolio_growth = (returns.dot(best_weights) + 1).cumprod() * portfolio_value

✅ What It Does:
Simulates portfolio optimization by using Genetic Algorithms to select optimal asset weights.

Optimizes for the highest Sharpe ratio by evaluating annualized return and volatility.

Plots the portfolio growth over time to show how the strategy would perform.

Key Extensions and Customizations:
Multi-objective optimization: You can optimize for both return and risk-adjusted return (e.g., using Sharpe ratio).

Use real financial data: Integrate with live stock data APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage) for real-time portfolio updates.

Add transaction costs: Include fees or slippage in the strategy for more realistic performance.

Expand with more features: Integrate more advanced strategies like mean-variance optimization, machine learning-based methods, or even Black-Litterman model.
